### What is it?
This project, Freeze to Stock, takes [Sycnex's Windows 10 Debloater script](https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater), including others soon, and uses it as baseline for what a debloated system SHOULD look like. You can see it in action [here from JayzTwoCents](https://youtu.be/DcDgV-1zDKs?t=859). Freeze to Stock then turns your PC into this debloated example for significantly decreased background CPU usage while gaming.

So far results have been promising on my 4 year old Windows 10 install (Yes, that is about 40+ chrome tabs open and suspended):
